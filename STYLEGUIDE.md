## Code Formatting

### General Rules
- Indentation should be consistent, preferably 4 spaces.
- Lines should not exceed 120 characters in length.
- Use UTF-8 encoding without a byte order mark.

### C# Specific Formatting Rules
- Follow the [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

## Naming Conventions

### General Rules
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variable, function, class, etc.
- Avoid using abbreviations unless they are well-known.

### C# Specific Naming Rules
- **PascalCase** for class names, method names, constants, and properties.
- **camelCase** for local variables and method parameters.
- Use `_camelCase` for private fields.
- Interface names should start with an uppercase 'I' followed by PascalCase.
- Avoid using underscores except for private fields and test method names.

## Commenting and Documentation

- Code should be self-explanatory where possible.
- Use comments to explain the purpose of complex code segments.
- Update comments when code changes.
- Document public APIs and provide examples where useful.

## Error Handling

- Always check for errors and handle them appropriately.
- Avoid empty catch blocks.
- Log errors for debugging purposes.

## Performance Best Practices

- Avoid unnecessary computations.
- Optimize database queries.
- Cache results when appropriate.

## Security Practices

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Follow best practices for managing sensitive data.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new code where feasible.
- Follow the [Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests).
- Document how to run the tests.

## Version Control

- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Use branches for features, fixes, and releases.
- Squash commits on merge to keep history clean.
